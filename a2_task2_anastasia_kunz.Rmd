## Data Visualizations


```{r}
#Height Plot
height_plot <-ggplot(data = palmetto_subset, aes(x = species_full, y = height))+
  geom_boxplot()+ 
  geom_jitter(aes(color= species_full), size=0.3, alpha=0.1) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(
    x = "Species",
    y = "Tree Height (cm)",
    title = "Tree Height by Species"
  )+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


# Length Plot
length_plot <- ggplot(data = palmetto_subset, aes(x = species_full, y = length))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(aes(color= species_full), size=0.3, alpha=0.1) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(

    y = "Tree Canopy Length (cm)",
    title = "Tree Canopy Length by Species"
  )+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


# Width Plot
width_plot <-ggplot(data = palmetto_subset, aes(x = species_full, y = width))+
  geom_boxplot()+

grn_lvs_plot <- ggplot(data = palmetto_subset, aes(x = species_full, y = green_lvs))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(aes(color= species_full), size=0.3, alpha=0.1) +

```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 2.** Boxplots comparing the aspects of canopy width (left) and length (right) between two species of palmettos, *Serenoa repens* and *Sabal etonia*."}
patchwork_lw <- (width_plot+ length_plot)
patchwork_lw
```

#### Canopy Length and Width Analysis
Between the two species of palmettos, canopy width and canopy length are relatively similar. Canopy length analysis shows that *Serenoa etonia* has slightly higher average canopy length than *Sabal repens*.

```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 2.** Boxplots comparing the average and distribution of tree height and the number of green leaves between two species of palmettos, *Serenoa repens* and *Sabal etonia*."}
patchwork_hg <- (height_plot + grn_lvs_plot)
patchwork_hg
```

#### Tree Height and Number of Green Leaves Analysis
Similar to canopy length and width, tree height also looks relatively similar with a more broad distribution in *Sabal etonia*. However, when comparing the number of green leaves between the two species we see that on average, *Serenoa repens* has a greater average number of green leaves than *Sabal etonia*. It is important to note that the distribution of green leaves is not normal, and it is helpful to explore the distribution through a histogram.

```{r, fig.cap= "**Figure 3.** Histogram showing the distribution of the number of green leaves between *Serenoa repens* and *Sabal etonia*."}
# Green Leaves Plot
grn_lvs_histogram <- ggplot(data = palmetto_subset, aes(x = green_lvs, fill = species_full))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~ species_full)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(
    x = "Green Leaves (n)",
    y = "Number of Trees",
    title = "Number of Green Leaves by Species"
  )+
   theme(legend.position = "none")
grn_lvs_histogram
```

#### Number of Green Leaves Histogram Analysis
Looking at this histogram we see a comb distribution for both species. *Sabal etonia* has a much more concentrated distribution than *Serenoa repens*.


## Binary Logistic Regression


**Table 1.** Binary logistic regression model outputs showing coefficients for each variable used in the model as well as the standard error, statistic and rounded p value.
```{r }
palmetto_blr <- glm(species_full ~ length + width + height + green_lvs, 
                            data = palmetto_subset, 
                            family = "binomial")


palm_table <- tidy(palmetto_blr)

palm_table %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```



#### Model Evaluation

```{r}
blr_fitted <-palmetto_blr %>% 
  broom::augment(type.predict = "response")

blr_matrix <- blr_fitted %>% 
  mutate(predicted = case_when(.fitted >= 0.50 ~"Serenoa repens",
                               .fitted < 0.50 ~ "Sabal etonia")) %>% 
  mutate(correct =  case_when(species_full == predicted ~ "Correct",
                              TRUE ~ "Incorrect")) %>% 
  group_by(species_full, correct) %>% 
  summarize(correct_totals = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = correct, values_from = correct_totals) %>% 
  group_by(species_full, Correct, Incorrect) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(Correct, Incorrect),
            percent_correct = (Correct/total*100)) %>% 
  select(species_full, Correct, Incorrect, percent_correct)
  

    
```

**Table 2.** Binary logistic regression model results showing number of species correctly
classified, incorrectly classified, and the total percent correctly classified.
```{r}
kbl(blr_matrix, col.names = c("Species", "Correct", "Incorrect", "Percent Correct")) %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), full_width = T) %>% 
    column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, background = "white")
  
  
  

```
